  ## Description  

  

  A browser based text editor for Javascript code writing.  

  * Motivation  

    This was an exersize in using webpack service workers to cache and deliver page assets to users for offline working.  

  * Reason for Building  

    This project was built to use wbpack configuration to imple=iment a PWA with asset caching.  

  * Problems Solved  

    This allows users to continue to work on Javascript files without needing a heavy weigth text editor if they already have a Browser installed. The caching mechanisms at play also allow for continued seamless UIUX and functionality even when the internet connection is unstable or interrupted.  

  * Things Learned  

    This project was my first dive into setting up a webpack configuration file and my first installable PWA. I learend a lot about the impleimentation and use of a Manifest JSON file and service workers in regards to how htey can give users better end experiences.
